I need you to create a structured Markdown description of my app for an App Store screenshot generator tool.

Here's my app information:
[PASTE YOUR APP DESCRIPTION, README, OR APP STORE LISTING HERE]

Please output the description in this exact Markdown format:

```markdown
# {App Name}

> {One-line tagline that captures the core value}

- **类别：** {App Store Category, e.g., Productivity, Health & Fitness}
- **平台：** {iOS / iPadOS / macOS / Android — separate with /}
- **语言：** {Primary language, e.g., en, zh, ja}
- **风格：** {Choose one: minimal / playful / professional / bold / elegant}
- **色调：** {Two hex colors: primary background, accent. e.g., #0a0a0a, #3b82f6}

## 核心卖点
{1-2 sentences that capture the #1 reason someone should download this app. This drives the hero screenshot — make it compelling.}

## 功能亮点

### {Feature 1 Name}
{One sentence describing the user benefit — not the technical implementation.}

### {Feature 2 Name}
{One sentence.}

### {Feature 3 Name}
{One sentence.}

### {Feature 4 Name}
{One sentence.}

{Add 4-6 features total. The order here = the order of screenshots.}

## 目标用户
{One sentence describing the ideal user persona.}

## 补充说明
{Optional: Awards, App Store rating, download count, press mentions, or other social proof. Leave empty if none.}
```

Rules:
- Write headlines that focus on USER BENEFITS, not features (e.g., "Never forget a task" not "Task reminder system")
- Keep the tagline under 10 words
- Choose colors that match the app's existing brand/UI
- The 风格 (style) should match the app's personality
- Feature descriptions should be benefit-driven and concise
